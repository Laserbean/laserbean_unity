# Data and Saving


## Save Anything
Functions to make saving any serialized struct/class easy to save to file/json. 

## CustomDict

A custom serializable dictionary. 


## Any Data Save
Contains a Special Dictionary which I forgot what was special about. 

Special Dict can be used to map strings -> SpecialData, which is a struct that contains one of each common datatype.
